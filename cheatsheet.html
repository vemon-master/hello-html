        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <!-- <h1> Paragraphs <h1>-->

            <!-- 
                It will be helpful to add notes to your reference sheet. 
                Paragraphs of long-form text containing complete sentences go in the p (paragraph) tag.
            -->
            <p>
                Headings from `h1` to `h6` identify blocks and sections. Every page must have one `h1`.
              </p>
          
              <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
              <p>
                Paragraphs of text go in `p` tags.
              </p>


        <!--Creating some lists-->
              <!--There are two important types of lists in HTML:

                    unordered lists (bullet lists)
                    ordered lists (numbered lists).
                -->

                    <!--The unordered list-->
                    <!--
                    Create a new heading for lists. Then, create an unordered list element (ul).
                    Add two list item elements as children of the unordered list element with the two list types and their tags.
                    Add a paragraph below to remind yourself how to list the items.
                    -->

                    <h2>Lists</h2>
                    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
                    <p>
                      Unordered lists are marked with bullet points and go in `ul` tags. Each list item goes in an `li` tag.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Types of lists:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Unordered lists (`ul`)</li>
                      <li>Ordered lists (`ol`)</li>
                    </ul>


                    <!--The ordered list-->
                    <!--
                    Next is the ordered list (ol). 
                    Add a numbered list containing Polya's problem solving framework.
                    -->
      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
      <p>
        Unordered lists are marked with bullet points and go in `ul` tags. Each list item goes in an `li` tag.
      </p>
      <h4>Types of lists:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Unordered lists (`ul`)</li>
        <li>Ordered lists (`ol`)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
      <p>
        Ordered lists are numbered and go in `ol` tags. Each list item goes in an `li` tag.
      </p>
      <h4>Polya's Problem Solving Framework</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Come up with a plan</li>
        <li>Carry out the plan</li>
        <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>
      </ol>

      <!--Anchors and Links-->
      <!--
      People navigate between Web pages by clicking on links. Now, you think you'd use the link element to do that. 
      NOPE! SURPRISE! GOTCHA! That's not what you use. Instead, you use an anchor element (a). 
      According to HTML for Dummies, "An anchor element is called an anchor because web designers can use it to 
      "anchor" a URL to some text on a web page."

        The anchor element uses the same attributes as the link element, primarily relying on the "href" attribute to point 
        where the link goes. After the lists, add a new h2 element that describes the section, 
        add a paragraph that contains some text about how links work, and then, in the paragraph, add an anchor element 
        with an "href" attribute that points to DuckDuckGo with the content "Go to DuckDuckGo to search for more information."
      -->

      <h2>Anchors (i.e. links)</h2>
      <p>
        Anchor tags create links to other pages. The URL goes in the `href` attribute.
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">
          Go to DuckDuckGo to search for more information.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting `target="_blank"` will open the link in a new window. See 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">
          MDN
        </a>
        for more details.
      </p>

      <!--Text Emphasis with em and strong-->
      <!--
      Create a new h2 heading for "Text Emphasis". Under this heading, create two h3 sub-headings 
      with the text "Italic" in one and "Bold" in another. Then add descriptions under each sub-heading to 
      explain which HTML tags to use for italic and bold text.
      -->
      <h2>Text Emphasis</h2>
      <h3>Italic</h3>
          <em>
              The `em` element adds extra emphasis to the text within the opening and closing tags. This shows up as italic text in most browsers.
          </em>
      <h3>Bold</h3>
          <strong>
              You can also use the `strong` element to emphasize text. This shows up as bold text in most browsers.
          </strong>


          <!--Organizing Content with div, span, and br-->

          <!--
          The div, span, and br elements are all useful for grouping similar elements together, 
          and for separating one group of content from another.

            The div element is the most generic type of container for other elements. 
            It does not apply any formatting or styling to the content within it. 
            As a block element, two div elements will have a line break between them.

            The span element has a similar purpose to the div element, but behaves slightly differently. 
            As an inline element, there will not be a line break between span elements.

            Add the following code to the bottom of your file to show the difference between div and span elements.
          -->

          <h2>Organizing Content with `div` and `span`</h2>
        <h3>`div`</h3>
            <p>
                The `div` element is a block element, so each `div` will show up on a new line.
            </p>
            <div>1st div</div>
            <div>2nd div</div>
            <div>3rd div</div>
        <h3>`span`</h3>
            <p>
                The `span` element is an inline element, so there will be no line break between each `span`.
            </p>
            <span>1st span</span>
            <span>2nd span</span>
            <span>3rd span</span>

            <!--
            When you need a line break in your non-paragraph text, you can use the break (br) tag. 
            This can be helpful when you are writing a Haiku poem to help you remember your favorite HTML tags. 
            Add the following code, using the br tag between each line. Replace the text on each line with your own!
            -->

    <h2>Breaking text using the `br` tag</h2>
    <p>
        Replace with Haiku line 1 (5 syllables)<br>
        Replace with Haiku line 2 (7 syllables)<br>
        Replace with Haiku line 3 (5 syllables)<br>
